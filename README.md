Ring signatures are a type of digital signature that allows a user to sign a message on behalf of a group without revealing which specific member signed it. The signature is created using a group of possible signers, or a "ring," and any one of the members in the ring can create the signature without revealing their identity. This makes it a useful tool for maintaining privacy in various applications, such as cryptocurrencies, whistleblowing, and anonymous messaging.
In our solution we use ring signature to give you access to proof of solvency while maintaining your privacy.
